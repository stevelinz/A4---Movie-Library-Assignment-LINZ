We are going to build a Movie library application

    Download initial movie data file - you will only need to use the movies.csv
    Create Movie Console Application
        1. List all movies in the file
            Note: Do not just scroll all movies - be smart about how to display
        2. Allow adding movies to the file
            Determine how to best figure out the next/appropriate movieId ("identity") value to use
            Do not allow duplicate movie titles to be entered
    Implement with the following features in mind
        Exception Handling
        NLog framework
        Consider creation of additional classes/methods
        Unit test (at least one test)
